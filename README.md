**Tesla-Related Incidents Tracker**

This repository contains a simple, interactive webpage dedicated to documenting incidents involving Tesla vehicles and facilities. The page features a table listing reported incidents—like vandalism, arson, and protests—complete with details such as date, location, incident type, a brief description, and links to sources when available.

**Key Features:**
- **View Incidents**: Browse a straightforward, easy-to-read table of Tesla-related incidents.
- **Submit New Incidents**: Anyone can report new incidents using the GitHub Issues page—no technical expertise required!
- **No Server Needed**: Built with just HTML and CSS, the page runs on GitHub Pages for simplicity and broad accessibility.

The goal of this project is to create a centralized, community-maintained resource for tracking and raising awareness about Tesla-related incidents. Contributions are encouraged—whether you want to report a new incident or suggest improvements, head over to the Issues tab to get started!
